### The quest to find India's top pet-friendly restaurant destination 

This project is an analysis of pet-friendly restaurant options across five Indian cities. Using Selenium I collected the count, ratings and cost-for-two of all pet friendly restaurants in five major Indian cities - Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai and Kolkata. This data was available on (Zomato)[https://www.zomato.com/mumbai/restaurants?sort=cd&pet-friendly=1&category=2], a restaurant aggregator.  

These data points were then visualised into a scrolly map and charts. 

I also collected some supporting data from (Google Trends)[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=IN&q=dog%20adoption,cat%20adoption,%2Fm%2F01m3sr&hl=en] to set context at the beginning of the piece.

The visualisations were created using Adobe Illustrator and Scrollama.
